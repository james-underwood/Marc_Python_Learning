# Introduction to Conditionals
# Conditionals allow us to make decisions in our code based on certain conditions being true or false.

# Example usage:
age = 17

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")

# Challenge: Write a program that takes a user's input for their age and prints:
# - "You can watch a PG-13 movie" if they are 13 years or older
# - "You can watch a G-rated movie" otherwise
