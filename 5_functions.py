# Introduction to Functions
# Functions allow us to group a set of instructions together and reuse them by calling the function.

# Example usage:
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("Alice")  # Calling the function with a specific name
greet("Bob")

# Challenge: Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.
